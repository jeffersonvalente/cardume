# Database Design

> Reason from principles rather than copying SQL patterns.

## Selective Reading

Read only the files relevant to the request, using this map, to keep context small.

| File | Description | When to Read |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `database-selection.md` | PostgreSQL vs Neon vs Turso vs SQLite | Choosing database |
| `orm-selection.md` | Drizzle vs Prisma vs Kysely | Choosing ORM |
| `schema-design.md` | Normalization, PKs (UUIDv7), relationships | Designing schema |
| `indexing.md` | Index types, composite indexes | Performance tuning |
| `optimization.md` | N+1, EXPLAIN ANALYZE | Query optimization |
| `migrations.md` | Safe migrations, serverless DBs | Schema changes |

## ⚠️ Core Principle

- ASK user for database preferences when unclear
- Choose database/ORM based on CONTEXT
- Don't default to PostgreSQL for everything

---

## Decision Checklist

Before designing schema:

- [ ] Asked user about database preference?
- [ ] Chosen database for THIS context?
- [ ] Considered deployment environment?
- [ ] Planned index strategy?
- [ ] Defined relationship types?

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Default to PostgreSQL for simple apps (SQLite may suffice)
❌ Skip indexing
❌ Use SELECT * in production
❌ Store JSON when structured data is better
❌ Ignore N+1 queries
