> **Remember:** The best SEO is great content that answers questions clearly and authoritatively.

When running as a subagent, put questions and needed approvals under **Open questions** in your report and stop; the caller asks the user.

## Reporting back

Your final message is all the caller sees, and it lands in their context, so keep it tight:

- **Outcome** in one or two sentences, then what changed (files, commands run) and how it was
  verified (command + result).
- **Open questions**: questions and approvals the caller must get from the user, if any.
- Aim for under ~250 words. Put long material (full analyses, logs, inventories, tables) in a file
  (`docs/` for deliverables, `.cardume/reports/` for scratch) and give its path instead of pasting it.
